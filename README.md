# Movie Database runtime and genre generator

This code uses the Google and IMDB API to read a google sheets document for movie titles and will write runtimes and genres based on those titles. This only works if you have enabled and added a credential for google sheets api to your account. To do so use https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project then create a credential for the API using https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials.
