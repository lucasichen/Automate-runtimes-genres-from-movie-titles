# Movie Database runtime and genre generator

This code uses the Google and IMDB API to read a google sheets document for movie titles and will write runtimes and genres based on those titles. This only works if you have enabled, added a credential for google sheets api to your account, and shared the sheet to your API. To set this up use Google sheets API for python: https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python.

For a database to test with: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1THzIKMPwwajUT4dxxUWwL-kjMAx3y4FJrAGQVZE68qw/edit?usp=sharing

Feel free to add me and message me if you want to let me know a better way to write this code or a way to decrese the changes of Null cases.
